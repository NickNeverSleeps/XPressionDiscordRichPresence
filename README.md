## 🎮 What is this?

This is a small, beautiful, definitely-overengineered command line app that tells Discord what you're doing in Ross XPression. Because why should only gamers get cool Discord statuses?

With this tool, you too can flex:
- 🎬 The scene you're currently editing
- 🧱 The type and name of the object you're poking at
- 🧠 The fact that you're probably deep in a graphics rabbit hole

Your Discord will proudly proclaim to the world:
> _"Nickneversleeps is playing XPression Developer"_  
> _Working on: LowerThird_  
> _Focusing on: Text Object: `Super Important Text Field`_

You're welcome.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Make sure your Discord settings allow Rich Presence:  
  **User Settings > Activity Settings > Display current activity as a status message**

- This uses Discord’s now-*vintage* Rich Presence API (DiscordRPC). Discord deprecated it, but we’re still using it like its 2015!

---

## 🧠 Known Limitations

- Will not auto-fix bad scene names like `FINAL_FINAL_v3_actualFinal_USETHIS`.
- Does not yet update your status to “crying softly in the control room.”

## 📬 Feedback

PRs welcome, but please include a 3-paragraph essay on why you think XPression deserves dark mode.

## 📅 Roadmap

- ☐ Get Jayme to actually write the foreword
