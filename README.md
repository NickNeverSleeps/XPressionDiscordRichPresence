# XPression Discord Rich Presence™  
*Because XPression integrators deserve clout, too.*

## 📝 Foreword (by Jayme)
### Who Are You, Really?

#### No, really — who are you?

For as long as language has existed, we’ve wrestled with existential questions: Who am I? Why am I here? Where will I be when the sun begins to dim and the light of humanity becomes the weak flicker of a candle's flame?

Today, in an era overwhelmed by a constant barrage of information, billboards, advertising, and social media posts from tech gurus and CEOs who belittle your contributions, these questions hit even harder.

It's time to silence the static and clear out the noise that invades our daily work and self-worth. This repository isn’t just about code—it’s a call to action. XPDRP *(patent pending)* exists to guide your lost soul, to help you answer the questions that seem unanswerable, and to fill the void that exists within us all.

#### Here, you prove that you matter and that your work deserves recognition.

Consider this:

*Repositioning a Quad:* Are you moving a quad into a bold new location on the main lower third scene, igniting the imagination of those who dare to envision how we might rewrite history?

*Animating Text:* Perhaps you’re adding continuous animation to your text—a relentless, swiveling declaration to the gods, "I AM HERE, I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE!"

*Transition Logic:* Or maybe you’re diving into transition logic with the fierce determination born of self-critique, proving that even the darkest self-doubt can fuel brilliant creativity.

All these questions and more find their answers here, often sparked by the vibrant discussions on our Discord channels across the web, and now you can be the master of all ceremony. This is your stage to let the world sing songs of your work, to boldly go where few dare, and to dream a future that’s as innovative as you are.

So go ahead—install it, immerse yourself, and let the world tell tales of your genius for years to come. Your journey to redefining the future starts *now.*

## 🎮 What is this?

This is a small, beautiful, definitely-overengineered command line app that tells Discord what you're doing in Ross XPression. Because why should only gamers get cool Discord statuses?

With this tool, you too can flex:
- 🎬 The scene you're currently editing
- 🧱 The type and name of the object you're poking at
- 🧠 The fact that you're probably deep in a graphics rabbit hole

Your Discord will proudly proclaim to the world:
> _"Nickneversleeps is playing XPression Developer"_  
> _Working on: LowerThird_  
> _Focusing on: Text Object: `Super Important Text Field`_

You're welcome.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Make sure your Discord settings allow Rich Presence:  
  **User Settings > Activity Settings > Display current activity as a status message**

- This uses Discord’s now-*vintage* Rich Presence API (DiscordRPC). Discord deprecated it, but we’re still using it like its 2015!

---

## 🧠 Known Limitations

- Will not auto-fix bad scene names like `FINAL_FINAL_v3_actualFinal_USETHIS`.
- Does not yet update your status to “crying softly in the control room.”

## 📬 Feedback

PRs welcome, but please include a 3-paragraph essay on why you think XPression deserves dark mode.
